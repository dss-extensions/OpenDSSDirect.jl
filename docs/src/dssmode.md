# DSS REPL Mode

**NOTE:** this currently [does not support Linux](https://github.com/dss-extensions/OpenDSSDirect.jl/issues/72). Contributions are welcome!

OpenDSSDirect also includes a custom REPL mode for entering OpenDSS commands directly.
This is similar to the Help (`?`) and Shell (`;`) modes.
Use the right parenthesis (`)`) to enter DSS mode.
Hit backspace on a blank line to exit. Here is an example:

```julia
julia> using OpenDSSDirect

DSS> compile C:\\portableapps\\home\\.julia\\v0.7\\OpenDSSDirect\\examples\\8500-Node\\Master.dss

DSS> solve

DSS> summary

Max Sol Iter = 15

```

The DSS mode also has help. Hit `?` at the `DSS>` prompt, and enter options or commands you want help on.

```julia
DSS> clear

DSS help?> clear
Clear all circuits currently in memory.

DSS help?> solve
Perform the solution of the present solution mode. You can set any option that you can set with the Set command (see Set). The Solve command is virtually synonymous with the Set command except that a solution is performed after the options are processed.
```
